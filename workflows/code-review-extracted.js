/**
 * code-review-extracted — RUNNABLE local copy of Claude Code's built-in (hidden)
 * "code-review" workflow (the /code-review high/xhigh/max engine; internally "bughunter").
 *
 * VERBATIM from the Claude Code v2.1.162 native binary, with TWO deliberate edits:
 *   - meta.name changed to 'code-review-extracted' so it does NOT collide with the
 *     built-in 'code-review'.
 *   - the 6 review-prompt constants (CORRECTNESS_ANGLES / CLEANUP_ANGLES / VERDICT_LADDER
 *     / VERDICT_LADDER_RECALL / CLEANUP_PRECEDENCE / SWEEP_GAP_FOCUS) — which the build
 *     inlines via ${JSON.stringify(...)} from scattered vars (pWK/BWK/UWK/FWK/gWK +
 *     u6_/hPH/vPH/yPH/di8/ci8/ZV_/li8) — are resolved and inlined here as their exact
 *     JSON values, also extracted verbatim from the same binary.
 * Everything else (orchestration, schemas, prompts) is byte-for-byte the original.
 * Run: Workflow({ name: "code-review-extracted", args: "<high|xhigh|max> [target]" })
 * Reverse-engineered for reference; original code (c) Anthropic.
